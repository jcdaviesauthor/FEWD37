  Brittney has been thinking about breaking up with Brad - from the Hamptons - for a while, but today was the last straw. Today, she asked Brad to pick up the <span class="noun" id = "noun1">NOUN</span>, but he forgot the <span class="noun" id = "noun2">NOUN</span>. Who eats [LINK FROM NOUN1] without [LINK FROM NOUN2]!!!
  </p>

  <p>
  Having taken all she can stand Brittney resolves to break up with Brad the best, most effient, humane way she knows how: via text.

  Brittney:
  Brad it’s you, it’s not me. (thumbs up emoji)
  </p>

  <!-- add Brad below (in texting bubble) -->
  <p>
  Brad:
  NO! I feel <span class="adjective" id = "adjective1">ADJECTIVE</span>. Who will walk my <span class="noun" id = "noun3">NOUN</span> and clean my <span class="noun" id = "noun4">NOUN</span>?
  </p>

  <!-- add Brittney below (in texting bubble) -->
  <p>
  Brittney:
  <span class="verb" id = "verb1">VERB</span> someone who gives a <span class="noun" id = "noun5">NOUN</span>.
  <p>

  <!-- add Brad below (in texting bubble) -->
  Brad:
  But I <span class="verb" id = "verb2">VERB</span> you!
  </p>

  <!-- add Brittney below (in texting bubble) -->
  <p>
  Brittney:
  Move on Brad! It’s Over! (random emojis).
  </p>

  <p>
  Later that evening Britney went on a girl’s night out. And Brad with his <span class="noun" id = "noun6">NOUN</span> between his <span class="noun" id = "noun7">NOUN</span> returned to the Hamptons to <span class="verb" id = "verb3">VERB</span> in his <span class="noun" id = "noun8">NOUN</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
  And they lived happily ever after (well at least Brittney did).
  </p>

  <p>
  The End. (random emojis.)
